## Sprint Day Three - Wednesday 19/02/25

  Wrote the sql which connects the answers to a specific role in the database,
  Created front end to the text based answer page, [app.css, TBQuestion.razor]
  Created layout front end with the next logo [NavMenu.razor]

  ### Issues
  Minor issue where the text answers another member wrote were too vague for roles, so for consistancy I was asked to rewrite the IT department questions. While this was not a major issue it took more time than expected to complete due to needing to research into some roles further.
