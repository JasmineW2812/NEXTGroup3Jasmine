# Week Six

## IT Session - Monday 24/02/25

### During session
Discussed the sprint with what we have achieved and what we want to get done ready for the next sprint.

**Individual:**
Continued working on dashboard front end for candidate,
researched the best method for pages to inherit the different layout styling (staff / candidate dashboard)

### Do before next session
Fix issue with buttons not being displayed correctly.
[FIXED] Created new css classes to seperate the buttons properly

### Issues
Using bootstrap and pre-made blazor component styles are causing issues with expected layout. To try resolve this I used inspect element tool to identify the problem and applied !important to override conflicting CSS from pre-built components. This is going to be a temporary solution if we have enough time to refactor the code later on.
## Group Meeting - Tuesday 25/02/25
**Individual:**


Finished the candidate front-end and replicated it for the staff dashboard keeping the design consistant.


Started connecting the CRUD pages to menu items (e.g., staff can now view, create, edit and delete the questions in the database through a menu option on the dashboard)

## To do
Continue refining dashboard and CRUD functionality

### Issues
N/A
