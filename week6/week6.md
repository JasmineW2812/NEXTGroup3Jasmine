# Week Six

## IT Session - Monday 24/02/25

### During session
Discussed the sprint with what we have achieved and what we want to get done ready for the next sprint.

**Individual:**
Continued working on dashboard front end for candidate,
research the best method for pages to inherit the different layout styling (staff / candidate dashboard)

### Do before next session
Fix issue with buttons not being displayed correctly.
[FIXED] Created new css classes to seperate the buttons properly

### Issues
Using bootstrap and pre made blazor components styles are causing issues with styling that should be correct not displayed how it is expected, to try resolve this by identifying the issue through inspect element and having to use the !important to override what premade css is causing the problem.

## Group Meeting - Tuesday 25/02/25
**Individual:**
Finished the candidate front-end and created the staff front-end in a very similar style.
Started connecting the CRUD pages to menu items e.g. staff can now look at the questions in the database through a menu option on the dashboard
