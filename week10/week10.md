# Week Ten Sprint Week

## Day 1 - Monday 24/03/25

### During session
Made it so passwords are hashed once a candidate has registered

Changed login to get hashed password

### Issues
Difficulty getting the hashed password system to work due unclear asp.net documentation [FIXED] finding a method similar using stack overflow


## Day 2 - Tuesday 25/03/25

### During session
Users can logout functionality

Continued with login system focusing on researching and coding authentication and authorisation so canddiate cannot access staff pages making the system much more secure

### Issues
Could not get authorisation to work with different roles e.g. when a candidate has logged in they could access the staff pages since it only checks if the user is logged in and not their roles
[FIXED] Other team member recieved support to remake the login system through the use of login model, sign up model etc 

## Day 3 - Wednesday 26/03/25

### During session
Started working on profiles for candidate and staff which they can view/edit/delete

Renamed classes in question page

Added links to login menus on landing page

### Issues
Working on profile while sommeone was fixing the login system meant a lot of how the profile worked needed to be changed. This was because we did not expect for our login system to change so much e.g. using different models and needing to change the profile retriving the edit/delete page a different method rather then through the user's ID

## Day 4 - Thursday 27/03/25

### During session
Continued working on the candidate / staff profile particularly on the front-end

Helped Jacob look into the chart issue for the dashboard

### Issues
Due to the difficulty of getting c# data to work with chart.js we were unable to finish this today

## Day 5 - Friday 28/03/25

### During session
Created the testing document - includes test plan, evidence of non-functional testing and test cases which were written by me and Jacob 

user guide- Includes all 3 types of users and screenshots

### Issues
Could not complete other tasks planned e.g. presentation or set up section in the user guide due to runnning out of time so these will be worked on during the weekend
