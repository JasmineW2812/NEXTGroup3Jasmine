# Week Nine

## IT Session - Monday 17/03/25

### During session

Made pull requests to merge branches to dev with Jada


### Issues

Some of the branches were quite old so the conflicts took more time to resolve since we did not want to override code that is more up to date, to resolve this we merged the oldest branch first and carefully looked at what the code was changing in each script being merged


## Group Meeting - Tuesday 18/03/25

Wrote the backend logic for candidate login, if there details are in the database they can now access the dashboard through an account


### Issues

N/A

## Group Meeting - Thursday 20/03/25

Wrote the backend logic for candidate sign up including encrypted password,

Wrote logout functionality for candidates,

Added and looked more into access levels and authorization on pages so users now have to be signed in to access the dashboard pages

## To do
Look into how the login system can be fixed
Fix sign up issue where a candidate can unintentionally create multiple accounts

### Issues
The login functionality gives an error when both staff and candidate logins exist [See screenshot in evidence] which is taking a lot of time to look into due to not much documentation on mutliple user logins for the way we have created it.
