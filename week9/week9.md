# Week Nine

## IT Session - Monday 17/03/25

### During session

Made pull requests to merge branches to dev with Jada


### Issues

Some of the branches were quite old so the conflicts took more time to resolve since we did not want to override code that is more up to date, to resolve this we merged the oldest branch first and resolved issues with older code first
