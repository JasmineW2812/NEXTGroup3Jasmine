# Week Eight

## IT Session - Monday 10/03/25

### During session

Researched into different methods of implementing charts into blazor and understanding how to retrieve data from the database to display on the charts

### Issues

N/A

## Group Meeting - Tuesday 11/03/25

Designed the front end of the charts and added fake data,

fixed the text answer page front end

### Issues
Due to working on multiple branches the front end on some pages is yet to be up to date with others e.g. the question page logo and menu at the top has not updated to the recent ones like on the dashboard so these will need to be merged carefully and ensure all pages are accessible and up to date on one branch.

## Group Meeting - Wednesday 12/03/25

Further research and discussion with group members on what data we require on the charts and what components need to be completed before this can be done

Created front end for the results page

## To do
See if any more components are needed on the dashboard and if they can be created yet if there is 

### Issues
N/A
